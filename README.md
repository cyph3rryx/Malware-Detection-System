# Malware Detection System with Dynamic Analysis

This Python script provides a comprehensive solution for malware detection and dynamic analysis. It allows you to analyze malware samples and benign files, classify them using a pre-trained machine learning model, and perform dynamic analysis on detected malware.

## Features

- **Malware Detection**: This code includes a pre-trained machine learning model that can classify files as malware or benign based on extracted features.

- **Dynamic Analysis**: It performs dynamic analysis on detected malware samples using a sandboxing tool and stores the analysis results in a specified directory.

- **File System Monitoring**: The script continuously monitors a specified directory for incoming files and automatically analyzes newly created files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-detection-and-analysis.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow scikit-learn watchdog
   ```

3. Modify the script to specify the directories where your malware samples (`MALWARE_DIR`), benign files (`BENIGN_DIR`), and dynamic analysis reports (`DYNAMIC_ANALYSIS_DIR`) should be located.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python malware_detection.py
   ```

The script will start monitoring the specified directories for new files and perform malware detection and dynamic analysis as needed.

## Dependencies

- `TensorFlow`: For the machine learning model used in malware detection.
- `scikit-learn`: For classification report and confusion matrix.
- `watchdog`: For monitoring file system events.
- `NumPy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `hashlib`: For file hashing.
- `subprocess`: For running external commands.

## Usage

- Ensure that your malware samples are placed in the `MALWARE_DIR` directory and your benign files in the `BENIGN_DIR` directory.

- The script will classify these files and print a classification report and confusion matrix.

- When malware is detected, dynamic analysis is initiated, and the results are stored in the `DYNAMIC_ANALYSIS_DIR` directory.
