# Malware Detection System

This Python scripts implements a real-time malware detection system using a pre-trained machine learning model and dynamic analysis. The system continuously monitors a directory for new malware samples and analyzes them using dynamic analysis. If a new malware sample is detected, it is labeled as malware and added to the dataset for retraining the machine learning model.
Features

### The system extracts the following features from the malware samples:

    1/ Size
    2/ Entropy
    3/ Imports
    4/ Strings

## Dependencies

    1/ Python 3
    2/ pandas
    3/ numpy
    4/ tensorflow
    5/ joblib
    6/ sklearn
    7/ pathlib

## Setup

#### Before running the code, set the following variables to the appropriate directories:

    MALWARE_DIR: Directory containing malware samples
    BENIGN_DIR: Directory containing benign samples
    DYNAMIC_ANALYSIS_DIR: Directory for storing dynamic analysis reports

## Usage

To use the system, run the code in a Python environment. 
The system will continuously monitor the malware directory for new samples and analyze them using dynamic analysis. 
If a new malware sample is detected, it will be labeled as malware and added to the dataset for retraining the machine learning model.
